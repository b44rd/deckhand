/**
 * The `/mcp` router. Stateless: a fresh McpServer + transport per POST, bound to the
 * authenticated principal, whose name the audit trail records.
 *
 * The credential is an `Authorization: Bearer` header and NEVER a path segment. It used
 * to be `/mcp/<token>`, which was safe on the assumption that the connector URL is a
 * secret — and that assumption does not survive Claude Enterprise, where a connector
 * added for the organisation is visible to everyone in it. The whole organisation could
 * therefore read the credential out of the URL and drive this Mac.
 *
 * So: two ways to hold a bearer credential, and both are per-person.
 *   - an OAuth grant, issued only after the operator approved that client at the machine
 *     (`oauth/pairing.ts`)
 *   - a local tokens.yaml token, which requires already being at the machine
 *
 * A missing or unknown credential → 401 carrying `WWW-Authenticate` with the
 * resource-metadata URL, which is how an MCP client discovers where to authorize. It is
 * deliberately NOT the old silent 404: there is nothing secret about the fact that this
 * endpoint wants OAuth, and without the pointer the client cannot start the flow.
 *
 * GET/DELETE (session semantics) are rejected.
