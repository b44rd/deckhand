Starts a preview and returns its shareable viewer link — or, if an equivalent preview is already running, returns THAT one (idempotent: each app keeps a stable URL, so this is also the way to answer \"what's the link?\"). With ref/pr it builds that git ref; with neither, an app with a local path previews its local working copy (dev mode — file saves then livesync to the simulator automatically, no pushing needed), and a repo-only app builds its default branch. Pass `alongside` to put more sources on the SAME page — another app, this app at another ref, a worktree, an arbitrary repo — and the viewer shows them side by side under one link and one PIN. That is how you compare old vs new: there is no separate compare tool or compare view. IMPORTANT: before every call you MUST ask the user whether to protect the link with a PIN or make it public, and pass that as `share` (this call fails until you do).
